## Intro

You have been hired by a bank to write their new account software. It requires the following features:

- Withdrawing money
- Depositing money
- Printing a bank statement

The architect has specified that you must use the public interface already added to the Account class. You may not add, remove or modify any of these method signatures. This does not include the constructor.

## Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance criteria is already in the AcceptanceCriteria class in the form of a test. Your account should print a statement such as:

DATE | AMOUNT | BALANCE  
01/05/2014 | 500 | 1400  
02/04/2014 | -100 | 900  
01/04/2014 | 1000 | 1000
